## Overview

Auth is a full authentication system built using FastAPI and Python. It provides a secure and scalable solution for managing user authentication in web applications. The system supports various authentication methods, including OAuth2, making it suitable for production environments.

You can download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Fawad2020/Auth/releases) and follow the instructions to execute it.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Simple and secure user registration process.
- **User Login**: Fast and reliable login mechanism.
- **OAuth2 Support**: Integrate with popular OAuth providers.
- **Caching**: Improve performance with Redis caching.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large numbers of users efficiently.
- **Secure**: Implements best practices for security.
- **Production Ready**: Built with reliability and performance in mind.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used for caching.
- **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines.
- **OAuth2**: A protocol for authorization, allowing third-party services to exchange user information securely.

## Installation

To get started with Auth, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fawad2020/Auth.git
   cd Auth
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration settings:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
   KAFKA_BROKER_URL=your_kafka_broker_url
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. 

### Example Requests

- **User Registration**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/register" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "password123"}'
  ```

- **User Login**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/login" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "password123"}'
  ```
